Computer plays an important role in our daily life. Anything we want we can get only
in one mouse click. Speed, reliability and accuracy of the computer make it a powerful tool
for different purposes. A very important and basic need of today’s modern business world is
the quick availability and processing of information using computer. One can easily get the
type of required information within a fraction of a second. The project that I have taken is
also in this category which is used in our daily life whenever we want to purchase some items
we can easily get them at our home. 
Objective:

system, which will cover all the information Related to the all products which is used in our
daily life. For example – Mobiles Phones, Laptops, Clothes, Books, Electronic Items and
many more. So by this GUI based automated system a user want to purchase something
